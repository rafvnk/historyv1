                    <p>The dot-com bubble is a historical economic bubble that was an age of intensive speculations in the US particularly between 1995 and 2000, known as the dot-com crash, the software bubble and the internet bubble. Nasdaq's Weighted Bond Index of numerous internet entities peaked in value on 10 March 2000, prior to the crash. The eruption of the bubble, considered the dot-com crash, continued between 11 March 2000 and 9 October 2002. Several businesses such as Pets.com, Webvan, Boo.com and WorldCom were involved in the collision. NorthPoint Communications collapsed and shut down Global Crossing. Others such as Cisco, which cut its stock by 86%, and Qualcomm have lost but endured significant portions of their market capitalisation. Many businesses, including eBay and Amazon.com, also fell in valuation but soon recovered.</p>

This would require the computer to process multiple algorithms and connect with other computers, which would be to much for the computer, but he had a better idea. Robert’s with the help of another engineer Robert’s idea of making special minicomputers to connect to each other. Now the computers only had to connect with one another software. On paper he had the network figured out, but no one wanted to build it at the time. The phone company had their own worries. 1968 was a mid-evil time. 1968 was the year the Robert’s had gone out searching for people to build his invention, known as the ARPAnet later to be known as the internet. Lawrence Roberts leads ARPAnet design discussions and publishes first ARPAnet design paper: "Multiple Computer Networks and Intercomputer Communication." Wesley Clark suggests the network is managed by interconnected ‘Interface Message Processors’ in front of the major computers. Called IMPs, they evolve into today’s routers. He placed Imp’s the processors are 4 different locations, 3 in California and one in Utah. He asked 140 companies to make a bid on his invention including big companies like AT&T and IDM.</p>

Although looking back it now seems like a simple process of attaching nodes to a network it was something completely new and we have to thank those who made the stive and efforts to push forward this technology.</p>
