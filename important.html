                    <p>The dot-com bubble is a historical economic bubble that was an age of intensive speculations in the US particularly between 1995 and 2000, known as the dot-com crash, the software bubble and the internet bubble. Nasdaq's Weighted Bond Index of numerous internet entities peaked in value on 10 March 2000, prior to the crash. The eruption of the bubble, considered the dot-com crash, continued between 11 March 2000 and 9 October 2002. Several businesses such as Pets.com, Webvan, Boo.com and WorldCom were involved in the collision. NorthPoint Communications collapsed and shut down Global Crossing. Others such as Cisco, which cut its stock by 86%, and Qualcomm have lost but endured significant portions of their market capitalisation. Many businesses, including eBay and Amazon.com, also fell in valuation but soon recovered.</p>

                <p>Hurley owns one of the biggest and largest social networking companies in the world, and that company is called Youtube, which was bought by Google in 2006 for around 1.6 billion dollors. Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson both run Digg. For Digg, it is the people that decide what becomes popular, whatever people “Digg” the most prevalent it becomes. Arthur Saltsburger, the founder of the New York times, believed that Zuckerbeg was smart but really lucky with the timing of Facebook.</p>
                <p>Next we see that in time of songs and music, we get to see the MP3. David Weekly, the founder of MP3 made it possible for people to be able to listen to multiple songs by allowing people to hold more songs by compressing the data.</p>

                <p>Where most of these companies are located, they're in Silicon Valley in California. That neighborhood is currently worth almost $3 trillion dollars. Figures like Larry Ellison, Jeff Bezos, Peter Theil, and so many others became multi-billionaires. It really puts into perspective on how much money is generated through these companies.</p>

                <p>Most of these say anyone can do it as long as they apply their idea correctly. I think this is very true, especially since we have so much information that is accessible. The creation of many more sites turning people into millionaires overnight are becoming greater, as more social networking has been greater.</p>
