                    <p>The dot-com bubble is a historical economic bubble that was an age of intensive speculations in the US particularly between 1995 and 2000, known as the dot-com crash, the software bubble and the internet bubble. Nasdaq's Weighted Bond Index of numerous internet entities peaked in value on 10 March 2000, prior to the crash. The eruption of the bubble, considered the dot-com crash, continued between 11 March 2000 and 9 October 2002. Several businesses such as Pets.com, Webvan, Boo.com and WorldCom were involved in the collision. NorthPoint Communications collapsed and shut down Global Crossing. Others such as Cisco, which cut its stock by 86%, and Qualcomm have lost but endured significant portions of their market capitalisation. Many businesses, including eBay and Amazon.com, also fell in valuation but soon recovered.</p>

                <p>As everything that comes crashing down, greed is usually the source of the problem. This is the exact thing that happened during the Dotcom Bubble. People and industries began to invest a lot of capital hoping for an insane amount of returns. This ultimately lead to the overvaluation of companies, a lack of research from investors, and pure market euphoria. </p>
                <p>Although major companies within this era fizzeled out and crashed, others like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM stood the test of time and are still running strong till this day.</p>

                <p>Since investors saw the huge upside potential by optimizing profits by getting in on internet companies early, people flocked on over to cash in on these companies. Since media outlets were constantly reporting on the antics and ridiculous surges within these stocks, even retail investors began to pile in. As I said before once a market enters a euphoric stage, greed takes over as the captain and once that happens the market will capsize leaving investors floating with a fraction of what they put in.</p>

                <p>I personally believe in history when insane and innovative technologies emerge there will be a frenzy of investors who pile in. Alongside with those investors, the euphoric stage of the market begins to generate companies or products bound to that industry and the quality of these products or companies aren't up to par. Which leads to overevaliation of companies and markets tanking.</p>

                <p>This can be somewhat comparable to the most recent market surge of cryptocurrencies. Although this new technology has an actual use case (Blockchain) there are a lot of cryptos out there which are cash grabs and can be compared easily to some of the companies that crashed and were overvalued within the dotcom era.</p>
