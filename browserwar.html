                <p>The major players within the browser wars were Microsoft and Netscape. These two battled out for dominance in the tech sector of browsers. About 90% of PCS were running Microsoft windows. That was until then Netscapeâ€™s success was starting wipe off Microsoft, leading for Microsoft to raise some concerns.</p>
                <p>Internet was becoming the full scale phenom, and Netscape was the head of it. It was looking particularly good for Netscape at this point.</p>

                <p>In 1997, 72% of the business was also owned by Netscape. But Internet Explorer 4.0 was released in October 1997 and browser war waves were modified. It pursued the released specifications of W3C faster and more loyally than Netscape Navigator 4.0. In browser battles, Microsoft has two key advantages. One was a matter of resources: Netscape began with almost 90% market share and a great deal of public goodwill, but it became financially fragile as a relatively small business which produced most of its profits from what was essentially one commodity. Gross sales of Netscape have never matched the cash-on-the-hand earnings of Microsoft.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>The other, most significant, advantage was that Microsoft Windows has an industry lock that could be used to take over IE. IE arrived with every Windows clone and thus Microsoft somehow managed to grow market share even though IE's prior versions were marginally less than Netscape's browser. And IE remained free because Windows' huge sales helped to fund its development and promotion, leading to drastic updates to Netscape so close it could not be downloaded and installed..</p>
